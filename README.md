 Data analysis of 2022 League of Leagues e-sports matches

This is a practice repo that I'm going to work on as I progress through the [CodeClan Data Analysis](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-analysis/) course to practice what I've learned, apply new techniques, and just generally mess around with. It's important to just get into the habit of using what I've learned, and why not do it with something ridiculous like the 2022 League of Legends e-sports match history? 

## Data
